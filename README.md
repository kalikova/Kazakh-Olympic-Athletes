# Kazakhstan-Olympic-Athletes

Dataset “120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results” is basic biographical data on athletes and medal results from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. This dataset file “athlete_events.csv” was taken from www.kaggle.com site (https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results#athlete_events.csv). Since I have decided to analyze the data only for Kazakhstan team, I subset the specific data and exported it into "kazAthlete.csv" file. Kazakhstan started to participate in Olympic games from 1994 after becoming an independent country.
